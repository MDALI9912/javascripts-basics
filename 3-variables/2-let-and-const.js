  //vaiables

  //var declaration with value
  var myName = "ali"

  //var redeclaration with same variable identifier
  var myName = "md ali"


  //let declaration with value
  let myHomeTown = "guntur";


  // we can't redeclare let variable again 
  // let myHomeTown = "ongole"; // javascript will throw error
